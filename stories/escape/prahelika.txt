Riddle by Harsh AKA ShadowWarriorPro#3003

It is not a monument,
nor is it a man;
Yet it is more famous,
than both of them;

It is older than me,
and older than you;
Because it was created,
when creation was created too;

The sea has an end,
and so does dawn;
But this thing my friend,
goes on and on and on;

It is just a number,
between nil and four it lies;
Although many tried without slumber,
they could not write it precise;

So famous that it has a name,
and that rhymes with a sweet;
It has got something to do,
with the shape of the sweet it rhymes;

Multiply the number,
with the value of thousand;
After the dot, delete all numbers,
sequence of 4 numbers will be in your hand;

For each number,
pick up a weight;
Place all of them,
at the exit gate;

This special number,
will end your problems;
And lead you to freedom,
if you solve this problem;

The riddle refers to the number pi (π).
It is a universal constant so it was created when the universe was created.
It does not have an end since it is irrational.
It's value is between 0 and 4 but all the digits are impossible to write.
It's name rhymes with pie and π is related to circles which is (usually) the shape of a pie.
π = 3.1415926....
multiply by thousand to get 3141.5926....
Remove all numbers afer the dot, 3141 is left.
3141 is the answer to the puzzle at the gate.
