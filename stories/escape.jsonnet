        There are faint lamps everywhere with limited oil.
        You found food and water next to you, but very little. You picked up one of the lamps from its stand, packed the food in your bag, and started exploring
        with (very little) hope to survive. You don't have a map of the place. All corridors look alike and you have no idea which monsters are waiting to eat you up.
